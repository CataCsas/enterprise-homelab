# Enterprise Homelab

This repository documents the design and evolution of an enterprise-style home lab with a focus on network segmentation, security monitoring, and SOC-aligned practices.

The lab is built to simulate real-world enterprise infrastructure using:
- pfSense as an edge firewall
- Cisco Catalyst L3 switching
- VLAN-based network segmentation
- A Linux-based SIEM platform

The emphasis is on architectural decisions, security rationale, and operational discipline.
